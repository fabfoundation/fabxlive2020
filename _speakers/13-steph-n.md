I am an Emergency Medicine physician, Assistant Professor and Director of Emergency Medicine simulation at Boston Medical Center/ Boston University School of Medicine.   I completed my simulation fellowship at Hartford Hospital and residency at University of Connecticut.   My areas of interest are novel model creation, evaluation tools, latent safety threat mitigation, digital education

I have always loved making things I wish existed!  I have created a number of medical procedure models for simulation based practice.  I am fostering innovation curricula and design in our medical school.  When CoVID reared its ugly head, I jumped at the chance to co-lead our medical innovations focused in improving safety of front line worker and patients.  I love testing out designs (none are too early!) in our sim lab to see how we really use them and what might be improved.  

Before medicine, I studied ecology at Michigan Tech in the far northern reaches of Michiganâ€™s Upper Peninsula.

In my free time, I love to get outside and kayak in our fabulous lakes, rivers, and estuaries.  Bonus points if the trip includes ripe berries for the picking!

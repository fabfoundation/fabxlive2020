Cindy Kohtala studies fab labs and material peer production through ethnographic enquiry, focusing on the potential for socio-environmental transformation. She examines makers’ techno-utopian imaginaries in enacting a ‘new industrial revolution’ and how makers self-organize and act to democratize and localize material production.

Hi! My name is Zach Fredin. I am originally from Columbus, OH, and most recently lived in Minneapolis, MN before moving with my wife Danica to Cambridge, MA for grad school. Before MIT, I started a neuroscience education company, sold grain silo radar level instruments, planned maintenance for a 50,000 ton forging press, and grew enormous quartz crystals. I studied materials science and engineering at Case Western Reserve University, where I worked as a foundry assistant and rowed on the crew team.

My [portfolio](https://zachfred.in/), which talks a bit about past projects and work. 

At CBA, I study digital materials, micron-scale direct-write fabrication, and asynchronous mechanically reconfigurable computational structures. During the spring of 2020, I also worked on a number of rapid [COVID-19 response projects](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/pub/coronavirus/tracking) intended for distributed FabLab-based community fabrication.

A square meter of printed circuit board consumes roughly a cubic meter of fresh water during its production.

I occassionally photograph woodland creatures.

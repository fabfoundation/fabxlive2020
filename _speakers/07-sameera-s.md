As an advanced architect and director of Needlab (Barcelona, Spain) I spend most of my time drafting human and environment-centred design solutions with communities, around the world. Currently, I am driven towards solving the UN Sustainable development Goals and making sustainable design solutions reachable to all.

I founded Needlab, after completing my Masters and Postgraduate studies in Architecture and Robotics from IAAC. Needlab is a not for profit organisation aimed to solve problems related to habitat and urban resilience in cities and rural communities. We have completed 46 projects on 4 continents - directly impacting more than 5000 people.

Iâ€™m truly fortunate to be a Yunus and Youth Fellow, FAB City Fellow, SIMP Leader, recipient of Design for all " GOOD Practice" Award and to have received the honor to speak at the UN-Habitat Assembly 2019, Nairobi, Kenya.

I'm currently working on "House for all" initiative which is a transdisciplinary based methodology that combines primacy of science and practice to sustainably solve the societal problem of secondary and tertiary homelessness.

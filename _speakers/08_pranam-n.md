Pranam Chatterjee is the current Carlos M. Varsavsky Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School and a recent PhD graduate of the MIT Media Lab and MIT Center for
Bits and Atoms, where he engineered novel CRISPR tools for broad biological applications, utilizing both computational and experimental methodologies. He has 
published seminal work on the discovery and enhancement of CRISPR-Cas9 enzymes for broad, efficient, and specific genome editing. These novel enzymes have been
employed to edit the genomes of diverse organisms, from rice to rabbits, and are further being developed to treat genetic diseases, such as Huntington’s Disease and
Rett Syndrome. Additionally, he has extensive experience in cancer immunotherapy, having co-authored foundational work on the functional mechanisms of PD-1
checkpoint blockade. Finally, Pranam’s established expertise in bioinformatics and machine learning are currently being applied for the development of in vitro
gametogenesis protocols.

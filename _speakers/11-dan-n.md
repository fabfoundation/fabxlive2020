I am a Manufacturing Technologist and Hacker leveraging traditional and new fabrication technologies and systems to design and manufacture in novel and more efficient ways. 

Through education and experience I am a Manufacturing Technologist: a combination of an engineer, scientist, technician, educator, fab lab guru, manager, machinist, welder and fabricator. I am able to improve the performance of any manufacturing system, from one machine operator to entire factory systems.

I have worked for over thirty years in various manufacturing environments inventing, designing, teaching, and of course making things. During this time I have learned as much as I could from others and taught what I have learned to others.

Currently I teach traditional and digital manufacturing techniques and associated design processes. I am an active participant in the HackerSpace, Fab Lab, and Maker movements democratizing design and manufacturing technology. I live the personal design and manufacturing revolution every day and can't wait to see how personal and community based manufacturing impacts the future of humanity.

Hi! My name is Zach Fredin. I am originally from Columbus, OH, and most recently lived in Minneapolis, MN before moving with my wife Danica to Cambridge, MA for grad school. Before MIT, I started a neuroscience education company, sold grain silo radar level instruments, planned maintenance for a 50,000 ton forging press, and grew enormous quartz crystals. I studied materials science and engineering at Case Western Reserve University, where I worked as a foundry assistant and rowed on the crew team.

At CBA, I study digital materials, micron-scale direct-write fabrication, and asynchronous mechanically reconfigurable computational structures. During the spring of 2020, I also worked on a number of rapid COVID-19 response projects intended for distributed FabLab-based community fabrication.
A square meter of printed circuit board consumes roughly a cubic meter of fresh water during its production.
I occassionally photograph woodland creatures.

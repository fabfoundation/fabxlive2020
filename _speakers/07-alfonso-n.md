Hola! 

Welcome here. Im a Research Assistant at the [MIT Center for Bits and Atoms](http://cba.mit.edu/). I grew up between Caniles and Baza (Spain) but my last 10 years has been in Madrid.
I am interested in structures, how to discretize complex shapes that enable controlled deformations with structural integrity. Right now, I am working on propose new structural and skin sollutions that allows curvature deformations and 2 curvature deformations. Since I was working at Airbus, to merge certain systems and structure into one same thing has call my atention.

Before coming to MIT, I worked for [Airbus Protospace](https://www.airbus.com/newsroom/news/en/2016/03/Shooting-for-the-moon.html). My lab was centered on proposing new structural configurations. I did some flight test parts, foldable antennas,research on Vortex Generators and Origami Sandwich configurations.

This pandemic we have been working hard here at CBA. Find [here](https://gitlab.cba.mit.edu/pub/coronavirus/tracking) some solutions we proposed in the CBA Covid-response.

Outside the lab, Im in love with Music. Before crossing the sea I left a band ;(. Click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tkr7SA4brS4) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP8rpX5avaI) to listen some funk progressive stuff.

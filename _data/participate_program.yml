This award was created in response to teachers all around the world responding to the needs of their students in real-time.  There were 4 winners and 5 finalists that received cash prizes to support their students.  There will also be an announcement for this year’s STEM Award.  In year’s past, we have partnered with Chevron to award over $40,000 to individual labs for their projects or activities to support STEM education.  This year, the Award will support a cohort of people in our community to develop ideas that support some of the needs for learning in a COVID world.

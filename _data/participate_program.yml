  text: Please join us for the announcement of this year’s STEM Award.  In year’s past we have partnered with Chevron to award over $40,000 to individual labs for their projects or activities to support STEM education. This year, the Award will support a cohort of people in our community to develop ideas/proposals that support some of the needs for learning in a COVID world. Award winners will receive  $1,000 each to pursue that idea, receive support from the group, and share best practices with the network.

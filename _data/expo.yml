  text: 'The Harp plays a 3D printer as a musical instrument. The interface has six rods, which when stroked cause the 3D printer to move its print head in six unique expressions. The force of the stroke controls the speed—and so the pitch—of the expression. Each expression comes from the gcode used to print each of the rods, so the instrument is in effect performing elements of its own construction. The frame is designed to look similar to the printer that is being used, an Ultimaker Original. Fab Academt Final Project 2018.'

- title: 'Solar Dome Dryer, by Shubham Shembade'
  text: 'India wastes around 16% of its agricultural produce annually due to its weak cold chain infrastructure according to a study conducted by Central Institute of Post-Harvest Engineering and Technology. We at Vigyan Ashram have been working on food dehydration as a means to preserve agricultural produce. Dehydration will not only save the agricultural produce from wastage but will also help the farmer get the right price for his produce since the farmer can store his/her produce when the market price is low and sell it once the price goes up.The solar dome dryer uses solar energy to dehyadrate agricultural produce. It has a black dome shaped cover which absorbs solar radiation and produces heat. This heat is transfered to the air which gets sucked inside the dryer through the holes on its surface due to an exhaust fan fitted at its top. The hot air gives latent heat to the water present in the substrate. The water then evaporates and is carried away by the fan leaving the product dry'

- title: 'Fab Train Model'
  text: 'The Fab Train Model is a set of modules that are part of a model. It incorporates a train detection system that moves a level crossing. This detection system can be used for other options, such as changing the signals or moving the motors of the changes of a station.

I have milled the frame of the model with the CNC. For the electronics I use an ATtiny1614 with phototransistors to detect the train and servos to move the level crossing barriers. The barriers and signals are 3D printed. These boards are integrated into a 3D printed box. Below the track I have integrated the box with the electronics and cables. I modeled the landscape with Blender to later manufacture the composites. I put the track and decorate the landscape of the model.

Fab Train Model is compatible with other modules with the standars. Fab Train Model is a sturdy, lightweight model with multipurpose electronics. It incorporates very precise details thanks to digital fabrication.'
